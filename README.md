# TreMoR-spectrograms-web-interface
This is the PhP interface used by http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/spectrograms, last updated in June 2013 when I left UAFGI. 
It does not appear that anyone at UAFGI has modified the code since.

See https://github.com/geoscience-community-codes/IceWeb for a more recent version and background.
